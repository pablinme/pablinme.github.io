This guide is currently a work in progress, all content along with source code can be found here. It is for beginners, specially for people who are starting with development, so here you will find the programming fundamentals while you learn Swift.

Code examples are meant to be for reference, it is better if you type them and experiment with them as you see fit, it helps with muscle memory as well. The best way to deeply understand code is to try and figure out what makes it work in the first place, so feel free to break it and keep learning.
