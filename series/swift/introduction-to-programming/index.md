Generally computer programming is the process of computing a result by building an executable program, the process itself is finite and most times involves working with imput data to get a result in the form of output data.

***
## Data
Data is the heart of the program since it defines input with which the program may work on, and most definitely is the output -result- it returns. Data that have been stored in a file is serialized in a file format, as programs that have some specific file extension.

***
## Programs
Programs are a sequence of instructions that a computer can execute or interpret, the readable form of a program, with which programmers work is called *source code*. This source code can be executed/interpreted by the computer in the following way.

Computers can only execute their native machine instructions, therefore it needs to be translated.

A **compiler** can produce an executable from the source code, by translating it to machine instructions. The executable file is loaded in memory by the operating system and begins the process of fetching, decoding and executing its machine instructions.

On the other hand, a language **interpreter** can compile the source code to an intermediate form that can be executed on the fly. This time the operating system loads the interpreter on memory, then the interpreter loads the source code into memory to translate and execute its statements.


Instructions in a program are statements on the source code written with a programming language, a sequence of instructions are called **algorithms**.

## Algorithms
An algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions that must be well-defined and specific to resolve a problem or perform a computation. Algorithms are used to perform a calculation or a data transformation, logic tests are used for decision-making allowing the code to divert through different paths.

An algorithm starts from an initial state (can be empty), then its instructions describe a finite well-defined succesive states that produce an output, it can be thought as input data gets transformed into output data when the initial state is not empty and it produces an output from that as a result.
